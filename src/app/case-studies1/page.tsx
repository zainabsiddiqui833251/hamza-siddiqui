            The client approached me with a reference to my old client. He mentioned that he had been trying for a long time but his PPC was not coming down from 55%, and his account was still in the red.
          </p>
          <p>
            I informed him that I would take 2-3 days to check his campaigns and listing, after which I would provide suggestions or a solution along with a complete report.

          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-[#339989]">Strategy</h2>
          <p>Let me share my strategy for this PPC case:</p>
          <p>Firstly, I analyzed the complete listing and PPC campaign and made a report according to the situation. Here&apos;s what I found:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
            <li>Impressions were good, but CTR was very bad.</li>
            <li>Main image was not appealing and competitive.</li>
            <li>Unit Session Percentage was not good, i.e., conversion was low.</li>
            <li>Many highly relevant keywords on which the client was running PPC were not added in the listing.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-[#339989]">Mistakes in PPC Campaigns</h2>
          <p>- Main Image & Listing Optimization: I evaluated that impressions were good, but the CTR of many high search volume keywords was not good. After comparing my main images with competitor images, I created two main images for testing, which improved our CTR significantly.</p>
          <p>- Keyword Analysis / BA Report / Root Keywords: I found that important keywords were missing in the listing. I optimized the listing by incorporating root keywords to maximize keyword juice and included misspelled keywords in the backend search terms.</p>

        {/* Common PPC Mistakes Section */}
        <section className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-[#339989]">Common PPC Mistakes</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
            <li>Targeting irrelevant keywords: The product has variations in shape, but the client targeted square and other shapes, which led to clicks but no orders. I turned off those irrelevant keywords.</li>
            <li>Running singular and plural keywords in the same campaign (e.g., "Cup" and "Cups"): I optimized the campaigns to prevent unnecessary spending.</li>
            <li>Exact manual keywords not negatively targeted in the phrase campaign: I added exact campaign keywords to the negative list of the phrase campaign.</li>
            <li>Phrase campaigns not optimized and having high ACOS: I started negative targeting irrelevant keywords generating clicks without sales.</li>
            <li>Exact manual keywords with high ACOS: I optimized bids and used day parting techniques to avoid stockouts during peak times.</li>
          </ul>

        <section className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-[#339989]">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>PPC optimization is still in process, and PPC is decreasing over time. TACOS is improving as the ratio of organic orders increases, and we are now ranking organically at the top for many keywords. Alhamdulillah, the client is very satisfied and has requested the addition of a second variation of this product. We are also moving towards category and video targeting.</p>

          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-[#B3C7E3]">Private Label Launch Case Study</h1>
          <p>
            <strong>Market:</strong> USA<br />
            <strong>Total Profit:</strong> $7,334.2 (should've been $14K easily, details of this lesson below)
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold">A $6500(+) lesson we learned:</p>
          <p>Did you notice above when I mentioned our total profit should've been $14K so far easily? Here's the reason: flimsy product packaging. The packaging was not sturdy and was prone to deformation. This wasn't our first launch, yet we didn&apos;t do our best work in packaging this product.</p>
          <p>As a result, instead of having $8K+ profit this month (as we did last month), we are going to have about $2.5K profit. The remaining amount is going into additional FBA fees that Amazon is charging us after they have rescanned our products. Our mistake was letting the supplier do the packaging how he wanted.</p>
          <p>Now that we've called our samples and brainstormed with the team, we&apos;ve shown the supplier how the same product can be packaged for better stability and reduced volume.</p>

        <section className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-[#339989]">Final Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Take enough time to gauge your market and competition. There&apos;s no space for mistakes when working on your price, pack size, and packaging. Do not shy away from investing in good quality content and media for your product. We chose the top 10-20 most relevant and converting keywords to use in our listing and PPC campaigns, so it's crucial to do thorough keyword research.</p>
